# Mushroom Classification Web App
https://mushroom-classification-using-machine-learning.streamlit.app/

This is a web application developed using Streamlit for binary classification of mushrooms into edible or poisonous categories.

## Introduction
The application allows users to explore different machine learning classifiers and visualize their performance metrics on a dataset containing mushroom features.

## Setup
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install the necessary libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application using `streamlit run app.py`.
4. The web application will open in your default browser.

## Features
- **Classifier Selection**: Choose from Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, or Random Forest classifiers.
- **Model Hyperparameters**: Adjust the hyperparameters of selected classifiers for fine-tuning.
- **Performance Metrics**: Visualize performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve.
- **Raw Data Display**: Option to view the raw mushroom dataset.

## Dataset
The application uses the 'mushrooms.csv' dataset, which contains various features of mushrooms and their corresponding classifications as edible or poisonous.

## Development
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
